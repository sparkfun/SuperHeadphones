This tutorial will guide you through how to build your own wireless and/or wired
headphones with ambient microphones. We start with some off-the-shelf headphones 
intended for use while lawn mowing, and then hack in some new electroncis to allow
wireless (BT), auxilary 3.5mm TRS input, and stereo ambient microphones. The original 
purpose of this project was to make it easy and safe to play loud music with a rock 
band in the basement, however, the inclusion of the natural sounds around you into 
your listening experiece can be useful in many other situations.

### Headphones

For this project, we chose over-the-ear headphone that provide a large amount of 
sound dapening (30dB). These types of headphones are also called ear-muffs and are 
often marketed for use during loud construction work or lawn mowing. 

The exact headphones we chose to start with were the following:

[Smoostart Am/Fm Radio Hearing Protector, Noise Reduction Safety Ear Muffs, 30db Noise Cancelling Ear Protection](https://www.amazon.com/Smoostart-Cancelling-Protection-Snowblowing-Construction/dp/B08M95FP4X)

When using this type of lawn-mowing headphones without any modification, they 
provide adaquate sound dampening to protect your ears in extremely loud places.
However, with this benefit, you also lose the ability to hear your natural 
surroundings clearly. Usually, it is described as sounding a bit like two pillows 
are held to either ear. This is because the passive sound dampening is blocking 
most of the high frequencies. 

In order to get the sound clarity back, we need to use ambient microphones. The 
correct type of microphone can accept the loud sound sources without distortion. 
This type of microphone is said to have a high acoustic overload point, or AOP.
We can send that clean audio signal from the microphones into the headphones at 
a safe listening level. In addition to a high AOP, the microphones also need to 
have a large signal to noise ratio (SNR), which helps avoid having too much "hiss" in 
the audio signal. Choosing the best microphone for the job turned out to involve 
a lot of testing. More on this later.

### The Modification

In addition to sound dampening, the original electronics included the ability to listen 
to FM radio and plug in a TRS 3.5mm audio cable. In this tutorial, we will remove 
the stock electronics and replace them with the SparkFun ESP32 Thing Plus and the 
WM8960 Audio Codec. The following two pictures show a comparison of the orginal
electronics (blue) and our new version (green/red/black). We took pictures of the
topside and backside of each for a more thorough comparison. 

The new version actually 
includes three PCBs. The red microcontroller is the SparkFun Thing Plus ESP32. 
The black PCB is an early protoype of the SparkFun Audio Codec Breakout. The 
green PCB below is a custom "mother board" that makes some connections between
the two dev boards and provides the on/off/volume knob, 3.5mm TRS input, and mounting
holes to mount this entire assembly into headphone can.

Using the WM8960 Audio Codec Breakout, we can mix together sound sources. In 
this use case, we are mixing together three sound sources:

(1) Wireless (aka "BT") audio from the ESP32 to the codec via I2S audio.

(2) Wired Audio from a 3.5mm TRS audio jack (common headphone cable connector).

(3) Ambient microphones mounted to either sides of each ear-can, to provide a pair 
of stereo room mics to your listening experience. In a way, these microphones are 
"giving you your ears back". Most importantly, doing so at a safe volume, to 
prevent hearing loss.
