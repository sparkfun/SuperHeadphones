!!! tip "Design Considerations"
	Please keep in mind that we may intentionally exclude certain functions of the board to meet our product design requirements.
	
	* *For example, our Qwiic Micro boards are intended to fit on a small board layout and only use I<sup>2</sup>C communication; therefore, we may not have the SPI and interrupt pins available for users.*

	1. Once received, the engineer in charge of the original design will automatically be notified.
	2. We will review your suggested improvement(s) to verify that they are within our board design standards and meet our product design requirements.
