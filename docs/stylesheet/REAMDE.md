[![Super Headphones](http://127.0.0.1:8000/SuperHeadphones/assets/img/history3.jpg)](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/22857)

This github repository contains all the supporting files to host a tutorial that will guide you through how to build your own wireless and/or wired
headphones with ambient microphones. We start with some off-the-shelf headphones 
intended for use while lawn mowing, and then hack in some new electroncis to allow
wireless (BT), auxilary 3.5mm TRS input, and stereo ambient microphones. The original 
purpose of this project was to make it easy and safe to play loud music with a rock 
band in the basement, however, the inclusion of the natural sounds around you into 
your listening experiece can be useful in many other situations.
