## CH340 Driver
Users will need to install the appropriate driver for their computer to recognize the serial-to-UART chip on their board/adapter. Most of the latest operating systems will recognize the CH340 chip on the board and automatically install the required driver.

*To manually install the CH340 driver on their computer, users can download it from the [WCH website](http://www.wch-ic.com/products/CH340.html?). For more information, check out our [How to Install CH340 Drivers Tutorial](https://www.sparkfun.com/ch340).*
